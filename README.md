# Polynomial-Regression
 This project implements a 1D Polynomial Regression Model using Least Squares and L2-regularization. The PolynomialRegression class handles fitting, prediction, and error evaluation. Experiments in poly_notebook.ipynb analyze dataset size, polynomial order, and regularization effects, visualizing errors and model performance.
